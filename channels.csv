5,Best Ever Food Review Show,"I travel to unique parts of the world on the hunt for the best food each country has to offer and share these stories with you in my videos.

Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable wit or enjoyed watching me eat interesting food like sea penis, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. 

Best Ever Food Review Show is the first food review show exploring the unique foods of each country with a fresh point of view and a punchy delivery, encouraging empathy and understanding of other cultures along the way. From the best street food to the most insane food markets to...well...yes, sea penis, nothing is off limits (except cucumbers. Cucumbers are off limits).

6,JuLingo,Hi everyone! My name is Julie and I am passionate about languages. On this channel I am doing profiles of different languages of our planet in order to inspire you to look deeper into them and maybe even to start learning some of them! I think that in the world where everyone tends to speak only one global language it is very important not to forget all the other languages as by learning them you understand the history and the mindset of people who speak them. If you think the same then it's a great reason to subscribe to this channel!,102000,False,6162008,31,UUb6-4FZu6N8zp8rVjzAqrcw

Hope you will like my poem on minecraft.üòÉ

Those lovely days,
Those sleepless nights,
Those furious zombie fights,
Those deep and dark mines,

We dug deeper and deeper,
Oh no its a creeper,
Mine and Mine more,
collecting iron ore,

As we wander and explore,
found a village near the shore,
loot loot loot,
collect some food,

What a sunny day,
weather is nice and warm,
let's build a farm,
potato, wheat and carrot,
Wait is that a dancing parrot,

All the time we spent,
we laughed together,
we explored together,
we mined diamonds together,
we killed dragon together,

Minecraft is not just a game,
its memory its an emotion to us.
We are the gamers.

HALH MONGOLIAN SHAMANISTIC STORY (without Buddist influence -I hope ;)
Not one but many gods created this middle world. They are called (TenGer) Tengri=""Sky"" There are 100 Tengries. They mostly don`t care about us. There is one god named Ad-ZetiGer who was disliked by others. So he lives in middle world. He created demons =invisible, flying, soul controlling creatures that can not be killed even by 99 Tengries. Only ZetiGer can control them. 
Human soul was not created here. It was created in Heaven. The mother earth gave it body. 99 Tengries gave it knowledge. The lord of underworld Erlig Khaan recycles or burn damaged souls.
Supreme gods don`t need temples cuz human body is better GER=house for gods. The guardian spirit Hii-Mori is always with us!

I`m Eastern Mongol. Halh Mongol. That`s why I present you stories about Erlig khaan. The main god of Halh Mongols.",3560,False,1739451,1029,UU5cD11itM57F5xGH6xw6ReQ

As a result, research produced within one discipline is not readily available to researchers of other disciplines, and this creates circumstances in which valuable knowledge about Mongolia and Inner Asia is underutilized.

The American Center for Mongolian Studies was established in order to facilitate and coordinate the various multi-discipline research activities occurring each year in the region. It is a consortium of approximately 40 academic and cultural institutions in North America and Inner Asia, including the National University of Mongolia, the Smithsonian Institution, Western Washington University, the University of Wisconsin and Indiana University.",1130,False,72129,144,UUDQ5ay8BeWwSgQV2IJlFsWw

344,V&S Twisted,"When I was five years old I had a recurring dream of a horrific variety show complete with commercials that just scared the crap out of me.  The main program had an angry clown chasing people through a house, and then it cut to commercial where the cast of Black Beauty stood there with the horse, and suddenly all their faces were ripped off by unseen forces.  Large violent tornados would appear and rip buildings in half.  The dreams were so traumatizing I decided to embrace them and make this channel with the hopes of trying to make a modern recreation of what I experienced back then. It features disturbing content, dramatized tornado images, creepy found footage, gaming reviews, and music videos.  We deal with topics from alternate realities to hybrids, cryptids, aliens, ghosts, scary weather, and zombies.  Enter and turn right at Freddy's gloves.  Bathrooms are on your left.

So far, I've eaten and filmed street food and local cuisine in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Eating the same food as local Chinese, Malaysian, or Thai people has showed me that it's best to travel almost solely for the food! My dream is to keep eating and traveling the world forever, a non-stop adventure!  I live to travel, and I know you do too!

The BarberShop was started with a clear thesis - India needs to create approximately a million jobs a month, currently we create almost two hundred thousand. Our ‚ÄòFunda‚Äô is to simplify entrepreneurship and make it accessible to everyone in the country so we inculcate an enterprising habit in the 23-24 year old of today.

After the love received by S1, we have decided to go beyond conversations on our podcast  to tangible help. With the help of our sponsors at BSC and Bombae we have put together a season which brings together a corpus of 50+ equity seekers looking to support 20+ start-ups in their growth and success.

488,Major_Riot_,"My name is Lance and I play Magic the Gathering competitively. I live in a small, rural mountain town at the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State. Modern is my favorite format but I do dabble in other formats, now mostly Pioneer. I have found that Modern to be the most fun and diverse format, most of the time at least.

I mostly grind through Modern leagues on MTGO. I do go to locals when I can and have played in a few larger events including Grand Prixs, now known as Magicfests. I will never claim to be that good but I would like to think I am not that bad either. I play a decent variety of decks and I mostly prefer to play midrange style decks. I practice almost everyday and I hope to become much better so someday I may be able to qualify for the Pro Tour!
